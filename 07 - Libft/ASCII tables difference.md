The difference between ASCII tables going up to 128 or 256 is due to the distinction between **ASCII** (7-bit) and **extended ASCII** (8-bit) character encodings.

### Standard ASCII (7-bit):

- **Range**: 0 to 127 (128 characters)
- **Bits**: Uses 7 bits per character.
- **Purpose**: This is the original ASCII standard, which includes basic English characters, digits (0-9), punctuation marks, and control characters (like newline and tab).

### Extended ASCII (8-bit):

- **Range**: 0 to 255 (256 characters)
- **Bits**: Uses 8 bits per character.
- **Purpose**: Extended ASCII was developed to allow for more characters than the 128 provided by standard ASCII. The extra 128 characters (from 128 to 255) include additional symbols, accented letters, and characters from other languages. These extensions vary depending on the encoding scheme (e.g., ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252).

In summary:

- **ASCII** tables up to 128 are based on the original 7-bit encoding.
- **Extended ASCII** tables go up to 256 because they use 8 bits, allowing more characters beyond the original 128.
