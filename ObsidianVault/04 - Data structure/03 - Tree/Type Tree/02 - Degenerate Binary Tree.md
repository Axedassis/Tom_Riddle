Also know as `Linear Binary Tree`. Every ****non-leaf node**** has just ****one**** child in a binary tree known as a Degenerate Binary tree. The tree effectively transforms into a linked list as a result, with each node linking to its single child.

Degenerate binary trees are less effective than balanced binary trees at searching, inserting, and deleting data, though

Degenerate binary trees are rarely employed by themselves as a data structure in general. Rather, they are frequently utilized as a component of other data structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues.
